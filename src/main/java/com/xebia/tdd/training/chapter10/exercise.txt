Requirements
=====================================================================

There are always few people who have couple of vacant non rented beautiful apartments and they are lazy enough not to 
get them enough attraction to be occupied. As a Product Owner I have a business Idea where I can see making some money out 
of these properties. So to begin with  

# I want to expose a rest service, using which people can Add/Update/Delete/List their apartments. An Apartment should have 
at least these basic fields.

* Apartment Address
* Number Of Rooms
* Apartment Type (Luxury /  Budget) 
* Average Price per Day
* Description of facilities near by
* Owner Name

# The URL of the service should be like  "http://localhost:8080/HotelReservation/apartment/" 
# Add/Update/Delete/List operation should follow the regular REST guidelines.
# When an owner adds an apartment as a response he should receive an apartment id , which 
can be used later to update/Delete/List the apartment.


Output 
1) Complete Unit Test for - Controller , Service , DAO.
2) A Smoke Test to verify the happy path scenarios.
3) Using a Rest Poster Client I should be able to do all the above operations.
